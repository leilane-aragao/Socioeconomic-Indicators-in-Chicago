# Socioeconomic-Indicators-in-Chicago
This project has been developed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate programme . It was undertaken by Hima Vasudevan, Rav Ahuja, and Ramesh Sannreddy, with contributions from Malika Singla and Abhishek Gagneja. The primary objective of the project is to examine the relationship between socio-economic indicators in Chicago and the occurrence of crime, with particular emphasis on offences involving minors. To achieve this, I have utilised three publicly available datasets from the City of Chicago’s Data Portal:

Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago – containing six key socioeconomic indicators and a hardship index for each Chicago community area (2008–2012) (link ).

Chicago Public Schools – providing school-level performance data used to create CPS School Report Cards for the 2011–2012 school year (link ).

Chicago Crime Data – recording reported incidents of crime in Chicago from 2001 to the present, excluding the most recent seven days (link ).

By analysing these datasets, the project aims to identify patterns and correlations between community hardship, household income, school safety, and criminal activity. The insights derived are intended to inform strategies for crime prevention, improve school safety, and support targeted interventions in vulnerable communities.
